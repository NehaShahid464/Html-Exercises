    <h1>The Story in the Book</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk lying between the copies of <i>Nature</i>, <i>New Scientist</i> and all the other scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <cite>On the Road</cite>. It had been Molly's favourire Book since College, and the longer she spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.</p>
    <p>She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Osacar Wilde quote proclaiming that <q>work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do</q>. Although many considered her pioneering Work unraveling the secrets of the IIama <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic Acid">DNA</abbr> ,to be an Outstanding Achievement, Molly <em>did</em> think she has something better to do.</p>
